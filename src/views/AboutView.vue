                As mandated in the WMSU Code, the University Press serves as a center for the printing of textbooks and reference materials, monographs, journals, periodicals, and other teaching-learning support materials and other printing jobs for both internal and external clients. The University Press is registered with the National Book Development as a publisher and a book printer and is the official publishing house for all the constituents of the university.
                <br/><br/>
                The University Press is one of the income-generating units of WMSU and is headed by a Manager. As the need arises, it also serves as a training center for mass communication students and other related programs.
